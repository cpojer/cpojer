Hello there! I’m an Engineering Manager at [Stripe](https://stripe.com) living in Tokyo with my wife and two daughters.

Originally from Austria, I've been building video games and social networks since 2002. I spent the 2010s at [Facebook](https://facebook.com) in Menlo Park and London managing JavaScript Infrastructure and the React Native team. I built [Jest](https://jestjs.io), [Metro](https://facebook.github.io/metro/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), and [MooTools](https://mootools.net).

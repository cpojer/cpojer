Hello there! I’m the CEO of [Nakazawa Tech](https://nakazawa.dev), an indie game studio and open source company based in Tokyo.

Originally from Austria, I've been creating video games and social networks since 2002. I spent the 2010s at [Facebook](https://facebook.com) in Menlo Park and London managing JavaScript Infrastructure and the React Native team. I built [Jest](https://jestjs.io), [Metro](https://facebook.github.io/metro/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), and [MooTools](https://mootools.net).

Recently, I built and open sourced [Athena Crisis](https://athenacrisis.com), [fbtee](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/fbtee), [ReMDX](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/remdx), [stack](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/stack) and various starter templates:
* [Mobile App Template](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/expo-app-template)
* [Web App Template](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/web-app-template)
* [Server Template](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/server-template)

I aim to build in the open and publish as much of my technology stack as possible. I write about Frontend Development, Engineering Management, Leadership, User Experience, and more. If you want to support this work, please consider a [GitHub sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/cpojer).

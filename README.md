Hi, I’m Christoph. For over 20 years I’ve been building open source tools that shape how millions of developers work, including projects I created like [Jest](https://jestjs.io), [Metro](https://facebook.github.io/metro/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), [jscodeshift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0pOgY8__JM) and [MooTools](https://mootools.net). I previously led JavaScript Infrastructure and managed the React Native team in Menlo Park and London.

Today, at [Nakazawa Tech](https://nakazawa.tech), I’m building new developer tooling and indie games in the open, including:

- [Athena Crisis](https://athenacrisis.com) — an [open source](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/athena-crisis) turn-based strategy game built from scratch
- [fbtee](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/fbtee) — the JavaScript & React Internationalization Framework
- [ReMDX](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/remdx) — beautiful Minimalist React & MDX Presentations
- [stack](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/stack) — zero-dependency, type-safe Stack component for streamlining flexbox usage in React & React Native
- Starter templates:
  - [Mobile App Template](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/expo-app-template)
  - [Web App Template](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/web-app-template)
  - [Server Template](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/server-template)

I’m obsessed with developer experience and performance, and I aim to open source as much of my technology stack as possible.

Open source has shaped my journey since I first published a project in 2006 and joined [GitHub in June 2008](https://api.github.com/users/cpojer). If you want to support this work, please consider a [GitHub sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/cpojer).
